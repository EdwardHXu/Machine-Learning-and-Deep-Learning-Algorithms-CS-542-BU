def affine_relu_forward(x, w, b):
    """
    Convenience layer that perorms an affine transform followed by a ReLU

    Inputs:
    - x: Input to the affine layer
    - w, b: Weights for the affine layer

    Returns a tuple of:
    - out: Output from the ReLU
    - cache: Object to give to the backward pass
